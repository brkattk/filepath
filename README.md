Filepath
========

A nice little interface for working with the filesystem in Node.js.

## Installation
The most common use of Filepath is to use it as a library. In that case, just
include it in your Node.js project by adding a line for Filepath in your
`pacakge.json`. For more information about your `package.json` file, you should
check out the npm documentation by running `npm help json`.

Alternatively, you can quickly install Filepath for use in a project by running

	npm install filepath

which will install filepath in your `node_modules/` folder.

## Testing
To run the tests, just do

	node test.js

You should see 'PASSED' as the only output. Any failed tests will output an
error message and halt execution. If you don't see anything, that means the
tests did not complete for some reason. You'll have to set breakpoints to
figure out where.
