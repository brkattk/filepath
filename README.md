Filepath
========

A little utility interface for working with the file system in Node.js programs.

## Installation
The most common use of Filepath is to use it as a library. In that case, just
include it in your Node.js project by adding a line for Filepath in your
`pacakge.json`. For more information about your `package.json` file, you should
check out the npm documentation by running `npm help json`.

Alternatively, you can quickly install Filepath for use in a project by running

	npm install filepath

which will install filepath in your `node_modules/` folder.

## Testing
To run the tests, just do

  ./manage test

You should see the test results output.
